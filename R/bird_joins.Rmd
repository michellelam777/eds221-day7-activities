## Task 1: Joins on birds
```{r}
# read in the data
bird_observations <- read_csv(here("data", "52_pp52_birds_1.csv"))

sites <- read_csv(here("data", "52_pp52_sites_1.csv"))

surveys <- read_csv(here("data", "52_pp52_surveys_1.csv"))

taxalist <- read_csv(here("data", "52_pp52_taxalist_1.csv"))
```

```{r}
# create subset of bird_observations that only contains observation for birds with species id "BHCO", "RWBL" and from sites with site ID "LIW" and "NU-C"

birds_subset <- bird_observations |> 
  filter(species_id %in% c("BHCO", "RWBL"),
         site_id %in% c("LI-W", "NU-C"))
```

## Left join practice
```{r}
# Use left join(s) to update birds_subset so that it also includes sites and taxalist information. 
birds_left <-left_join(x = birds_subset, y = sites, by = "site_id") |> 
  left_join(y = taxalist, by = "species_id")
```

## Full join practice
```{r}
# Write code to full_join the birds_subset and sites data into a new object called birds_full
birds_full <- full_join(birds_subset, sites, by = "site_id")
```

## Inner join practice
```{r}
#Write code to inner_join() the birds_subset and taxalist, called birds_inner. Include an argument for what variable youâ€™ll be joining by.
birds_inner <- inner_join(birds_subset, taxalist, by = "species_id")

birds_left_2 <- left_join(birds_subset, taxalist, by = "species_id")
```

## Task 2: Data wrangling and visualization with birds
```{r}
birds <- bird_observations |> 
  rename(bird_obs_notes = notes) |> 
  left_join(sites, by = "site_id") |> 
  left_join(taxalist, by = "species_id") |> 
  left_join(surveys, by = c("survey_id", "site_id")) |> 
 select(survey_date, common_name, park_name, bird_count) |> 
  mutate(survey_month = month(survey_date)) |> 
  mutate(survey_month = as.factor(survey_month)) |>
  relocate(survey_month, .after = survey_date) |> 
  group_by(park_name, survey_month) |> 
  summarize(count = n()) |> 
  filter(park_name %in% c("Lindo", "Orme", "Palomino", "Sonrisa"))
```
